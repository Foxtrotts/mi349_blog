            <h2>How Not to Disappoint Your Parents This Thanksgiving</h2>

            <p>Picture this, it is Thanksgiving Day, and you invited your parents over and offered to cook to give back for all those years you always took the last slice of pumpkin pie. I mean, no one touched it for a whole five minutes so it was fair game, right? Anyway, you insisted that you could get everything set up and have the food ready to serve the day of. That is your first mistake. If you wait to do everything at the last minute your turkey will be done well past your parent’s arrival time, and you will be met with exasperated sighs and despondent smiles. Try to start setting up at least a day before, it will help you relax, and let you worry about more important issues, like how are your parents going to judge your one-room apartment, which you spend double the median cost of rent in your area. <strong>You can not forget the pumpkin pie.</strong> It lies at the center of all Thanksgiving dinners and without it, Thanksgiving will be joyless and without reason, but make sure you have enough for everybody, or it might be your snotty nephew taking the last piece of pie, instead of you.</p>

            <h2>IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT</h2>
            <time datetime="2021-10-12">October 12 2021</time>
            <address class="author"><a rel="author" href="about.html">Daniel Fox</a></address>

            <p>This actually is not an important announcement, I just wanted your attention. Do I have it? Good. Today I will be discussing the most efficient way to cut an onion. Before we begin, you are going to need some equipment, more specifically a variety of onions of your choosing, a sharp knife, and a cutting board (optional). Once you have everything gathered, you are going to want to wash your hands, the last thing you want is leftover conjunctivitis that you picked up while on the bus to be on your onion. After washing your hands, peel the onion, and get ready to cut. This next step is the most important part of the process, under no circumstances can you skip it. Next, cut the onion into whatever size you desire. If you start to cry, don’t. At this point, now that the onion is sliced and or diced, you are almost done. The final step is to enjoy your onions! You put in the work, and you came out on top. You showed that onion who is the CEO of onion town, and it was not the shallot. The feast of the onion commences, and you, the king of onion.</p>
