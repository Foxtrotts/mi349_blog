           <h2>Who is Daniel Fox?</h2>
           <p>I am just a guy who writes satire badly. A good example is my blog posts. You can ignore them, they are just for me to look back on and cringe at myself. I am known for sleeping in way too late, and eating an absurd amount of frozen pizza, and I am currently majoring in Media and Information.</p>
           <p>I want to  eventually use my degree to kickstart my freelance career of social media management/branding, and knowing how to make a website seems like a step in the right direction.</p>
